    <h2>Circadian Rhythm</h2>
    <p class="viz-instructions">
        This visualization shows mouse movement patterns and body temperature over multiple day/night cycles. The main plot (left) displays mouse positions and their movement (more active movement represent higher activity levels), while the right plot shows the relationship between temperature and activity levels. The color of each point represents the body temperature of the mouse.
    </p>
    <ul class="viz-features">
        <li><strong>Mouse Movement:</strong> Each point represents a mouse, with colors indicating body temperature (blue: cooler, red: warmer).</li>
        <li><strong>Day/Night Cycles:</strong> Background changes indicate light conditions, with the status shown in the top-right corner.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Features:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Hover over any point to see detailed mouse data and highlight the same mouse in both plots</li>
                <li>Hover pauses the animation automatically</li>
                <li>Use the time slider to navigate through the data</li>
                <li>Play/Pause and Reset buttons control the animation</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Temperature Scale:</strong> The color bar below the main plot shows the temperature range from 35°C (blue) to 39°C (red).</li>

        <strong>Question to consider:</strong> How do the activity patterns of these mice across day and night cycles reveal their natural circadian rhythm?

    <p class="viz-answer" style="display: none;">
        <strong>Our suggested answer:</strong> The visualization reveals clear circadian patterns in mouse behavior. During light-off periods (night), mice consistently show heightened activity levels, coupled with elevated body temperatures (shown by warmer colors). Conversely, during light-on periods (day), their activity decreases significantly, and body temperatures tend to be cooler. This day-night activity pattern strongly indicates nocturnal behavior, which is an evolutionary adaptation common in rodents. The synchronization between activity levels and body temperature also demonstrates how circadian rhythms coordinate multiple physiological processes to optimize survival during their most active periods.
