    <!-- Circadian Rhythm -->
    <h2>Circadian Rhythm</h2>
    <p class="viz-instructions">
        This visualization shows mouse movement patterns and body temperature over multiple day/night cycles. The main plot (left) displays mouse positions and their movement (more active movement represent higher activity levels), while the right plot shows the relationship between temperature and activity levels. The color of each point represents the body temperature of the mouse.
    </p>
    <ul class="viz-features">
        <li><strong>Mouse Movement:</strong> Each point represents a mouse, with colors indicating body temperature (blue: cooler, red: warmer).</li>
        <li><strong>Day/Night Cycles:</strong> Background changes indicate light conditions, with the status shown in the top-right corner.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Features:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Hover over any point to see detailed mouse data and highlight the same mouse in both plots</li>
                <li>Hover pauses the animation automatically</li>
                <li>Use the time slider to navigate through the data</li>
                <li>Play/Pause and Reset buttons control the animation</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Temperature Scale:</strong> The color bar below the main plot shows the temperature range from 35°C (blue) to 39°C (red).</li>

        <strong>Question to consider:</strong> How do the activity patterns of these mice across day and night cycles reveal their natural circadian rhythm?
    </p>
    <button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show our suggested answer</button>
    <p class="viz-answer" style="display: none;">
        <strong>Our suggested answer:</strong> The visualization reveals clear circadian patterns in mouse behavior. During light-off periods (night), mice consistently show heightened activity levels, coupled with elevated body temperatures (shown by warmer colors). Conversely, during light-on periods (day), their activity decreases significantly, and body temperatures tend to be cooler. This day-night activity pattern strongly indicates nocturnal behavior, which is an evolutionary adaptation common in rodents. The synchronization between activity levels and body temperature also demonstrates how circadian rhythms coordinate multiple physiological processes to optimize survival during their most active periods.

    <!-- Activity Ranking Visualization -->
    <h2>Activity Rankings: Day vs Night Comparison</h2>
    <p class="viz-instructions">
        This visualization compares mouse activity levels between light-off (night) and light-on (day) periods using dual bar charts. The upper chart shows activity during light-off periods with upward bars, while the lower chart shows activity during light-on periods with downward bars. Mice are automatically sorted by their activity levels in descending order at each time point.
    </p>
    <ul class="viz-features">
        <li><strong>Dual Bar Charts:</strong> Upper bars (night) and lower bars (day) allow direct comparison of activity levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Sorting:</strong> Mice are ranked by activity level at each time point, creating a dynamic leaderboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Color Coding:</strong> Blue bars represent male mice, pink bars represent female mice.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Controls:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Time slider to navigate through a 12-hour cycle (720 minutes)</li>
                <li>Day selector to jump between different days</li>
                <li>Play/Pause animation to see activity changes over time</li>
                <li>Hover over bars to see detailed mouse information</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Equal Scale:</strong> Both upper and lower charts use the same activity scale for fair comparison.</li>

        <strong>Question to consider:</strong> How do the activity rankings change between day and night periods, and what does this tell us about individual mouse behavior patterns?
    </p>
    <button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show our suggested answer</button>
    <p class="viz-answer" style="display: none;">
        <strong>Our suggested answer:</strong> The activity rankings reveal distinct differences between day and night periods. During night periods, mice generally show much higher activity levels and more variation between individuals, with some mice being consistently highly active while others remain relatively inactive. During day periods, most mice show significantly reduced activity levels, with rankings often flattening out as mice enter their rest phase. Individual differences become more pronounced during active periods, suggesting that some mice are naturally more active than others during their preferred activity time. The consistent appearance of certain mice at the top of the rankings during night periods indicates individual behavioral traits and circadian rhythm strength variations within the population.

<h2>Initial Prototype Writeup</h2>
<div class="reflection-box">
<p>
    So far, we have created our central visualization and have laid out the template for any additional visualizations. The central visualization is an overview of most of the features all at once. It aims to show viewers the general heat and activity trends of mice throughout each period of day and night. Smaller future visualizations will focus on more specific aspects of the dataset. By creating visualization and suggested response templates, additional work for the project will be streamlined. Our process is to add in a short visualization to guide viewers through the interactive visualization, add a d3 plot, ask viewers an insightful question, and to answer their question using the drop-down suggested answer component. Using this format, our project can meet its original goal of teaching researchers about their mice in an engaging way, but can also be used to teach people (especially children) how to gain insight from a graph or visualization.
</p>
<p>
    The most challenging part of the project remaining is to curate a few more visualizations that feel fresh and interactive. Our dataset is limited in its number of features (we can explore activity, temperature, gender, and estrus cycles), and so we'll need to work to create visualizations that add insight without feeling redundant. Our second challenge will be to come up with critical engagement questions that strike a balance between being too technical and boringly simple. A mix of difficulties will be beneficial, and our target is for the level of engagement to be at the point to make an older kid think for a few minutes and require most viewers to take a second look at the visualization before answering. These questions give us the most opportunity to ensure that scientists aren't missing interesting details and to promote learning for the rest of our audience, so it's important that we get their level of difficulty right.
