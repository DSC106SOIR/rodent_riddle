            <strong>Our suggested answer:</strong> We can see three-quarters of mice activity are done at night, which shows mice are nocturnal animals. On the other hand, we cannot see any sex dependency on the activity level.

        <p class="viz-answer" style="display: none;">
            <strong>Our suggested answer:</strong> The visualization reveals clear circadian patterns in mouse behavior. During light-off periods (night), mice consistently show heightened activity levels, coupled with elevated body temperatures (shown by warmer colors). Conversely, during light-on periods (day), their activity decreases significantly, and body temperatures tend to be cooler. This day-night activity pattern strongly indicates nocturnal behavior, which is an evolutionary adaptation common in rodents. The synchronization between activity levels and body temperature also demonstrates how circadian rhythms coordinate multiple physiological processes to optimize survival during their most active periods.

            <strong>Our suggested answer:</strong> The temperature feature is useful in predicting mouse gender, since females tend to be hotter at each hour of the day. 
            Still, after checking percentiles, it's clear that the hottest male mice are often hotter than the coldest male mice, meaning that there is no 
            perfect value that separates the genders.

        <button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show our suggested answer</button>
        <p class="viz-answer" style="display: none;">
            <strong>Our suggested answer:</strong> The visualization reveals interesting patterns in gender-based activity levels. Overall, male mice tend to show higher activity levels compared to female mice across both day and night periods. However, during estrus days, we observe a notable increase in female activity levels that extends beyond just the night period. While this increased activity doesn't surpass the overall male activity levels, it represents a significant behavioral change in female mice during their reproductive cycle. The mini-plots showing gender activity proportions help visualize these patterns, with the male proportion typically being higher but showing interesting variations during estrus periods. These findings suggest that while male mice maintain generally higher activity levels, female activity patterns are more dynamic and influenced by their reproductive state.

        <button class="show-answer-btn" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show our suggested answer</button>
        <p class="viz-answer" style="display: none;">
            <strong>Our suggested answer:</strong> The visualization reveals that estrus affects mouce temperature starting from around 4hours(240 minutes) later after light is turned off(night starts) and ends around 5hours(300 minutes) later after light is turned on(day starts). During that period, average temperature is 0.6°C higher than that in other period at maximum, which is quite large considering that mice is homeotherm. Regarding activity level, estrus activates as well but affected duration is a little different from the case of body temperature. Around the same time body temperature increases, activity level also increases but it ends around 1hour later light is turned on(day starts), which ends earlier than body temperature increasing. Hence we can say that estrus let female mice move a lot to find male mice to breed which is one factor that increase body temperature. In addition, the level of estrogen increases significantly. This leads to the stimulation of the hypothalamus and thermoregulatory centers, which can raise the set point for body temperature and Increasing basal metabolic rate (BMR), resulting in more internal heat production.
            Other than estrus day, we can see the mice one day before estrus day has high body temperature and activity level compared to others. It is because female mice start to prepare for the estrus. As we can see estrus increases mouce body temperature and activity level highest on the day but starting one day before that as well.
